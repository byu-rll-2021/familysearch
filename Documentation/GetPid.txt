FamilySearch.GetPid()

DESCRIPTION:

	Gets all FamilySearch pids attached to a list of ark ids. 
	This will take an infile and rewrite it (as long as you have a csv). 
    	Otherwise it will write to a csv with the same name as the infile.

EXAMPLE CODE:

	#import familysearch class
	import sys
	sys.path.append('R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/all_code')
	from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch

	test = FamilySearch('USERNAME','PASSWORD','DIRECTORY','INFILE.csv','OUTFILE.csv',auth=True)
	test.GetPid()

GENERAL INFILE FORMATTING:
	
	The infile should be two columns, a list of unique indicies and one of
    	the FamilySearch arkids, in that order with headers. The names don't matter.
    	It can be a csv, a dta, or an xlsx file.
