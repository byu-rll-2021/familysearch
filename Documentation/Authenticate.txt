FamilySeach.Authenticate()


NOTE:

This code will read in the 'Authentication_Key.txt' file found in the main folder and check if the key there
is currently valid. Otherwise it will log in to FamilySearch and get another API key.


RETURNS:

A valid API key.


EXAMPLE CODE:

fs = FamilySearch('username', 'password', 'directory')
key = fs.Authenticate()
