DESCRIPTION:

	Scrapes all censuses (or the specified year) attached to an individual.
	This will only handle direct links to the FamilySearch censuses.

	import sys
	sys.path.append('R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/all_code')
	from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch

	test = FamilySearch('USERNAME','PASSWORD','DIRECTORY','INFILE.csv','OUTFILE.csv',auth=True)
	test.AttachedCensus(year='1940')

GENERAL INFILE FORMATTING:
	
	Save in .csv format, it should be two columns, a list of unique indicies and one of
    	the FamilySearch pids, in that order with no header.
