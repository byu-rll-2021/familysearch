FamilySeach.ReplaceDeleted(sheet_list, idcol, google_sheet=True, header=True, delim=",")

This function uses the google and family search APIs to get FSIDs from a 
google sheet and get the new ids of all of the people that are on the list
that got merged into another person's profile and was consequently deleted.
I am not sure about the run time but an approximate time remaining will be
printed to the console.

PARAMETERS:

google_sheet: bool
	Defaults to true. This is a just a switch statement so the program
	knows whether to look for a google sheet or a file

sheet_list: string or list
	Declares which google sheets/files will be looked at for deleted observations.
	given https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jhn5D1HFWnDr3JHgu3E6ktbuL7FIUvmSLGfIxZj9ZVk/edit#gid=0
        	sheet_list[i]   = "1jhn5D1HFWnDr3JHgu3E6ktbuL7FIUvmSLGfIxZj9ZVk"
	***Note: if only one sheet is desired it may be entered as a string and it
        	will be coerced into a list with one element 

idcol: google_sheet=True: string/ google_sheet=False: int
	each column in a google sheet has a corresponding letter key. This
	uses the one given as the column of FSIDs to be used and replaced.
	The number you put will automatically have one subtracted
	from it so start you count with 1 so that python can do its thing
	starting at 0 with indices.

header: bool
	Whether or not there are headers in the file. The code will never change
	the first element unless you declare header=False.

delim: str
	This is only necessary for the google_sheet=False option.
	The default is a csv reader but you can insert a "\t" for
	a tsv or any other delimiter in a basic raw data file 


METHODS:
This is a method of the FamilySearch class.
It is built with functions from the file google_helpers.py
and other methods of the FamilySearch class but has none 
of its own.

EXAMPLE CODE:

For a Google Sheet:

import os
os.chdir(r"R:\JoePriceResearch\Python\all_code")
from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch
test = FamilySearch('familysearchuser', 'secretpassword', "any\directory\here\you\wont\use\it\with\this")
test.ReplaceDeleted("1jhn5D1HFWnDr3JHgu3E6ktbuL7FIUvmSLGfIxZj9ZVk", "a")

For a file saved on the computer:

from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch
test = FamilySearch('familysearchuser', 'secretpassword', "any\directory\here\you\wont\use\it\with\this")
test.ReplaceDeleted("Z:\Insert\Real\Directory\Here\file.tsv", 2, google_sheet=False, header=False, delim="\t")
	* the file path can be given to the initialization of the FamilySearch object and then only the
	  filename should be needed as an argument for ReplaceDeleted() 


HOW TO RUN FROM COMMAND LINE (Guaranteed to work on campus computers):
1. Open a command prompt
2. Copy this line of code, replacing the parameters as needed
"R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/Anaconda3/python.exe" -c "import sys; sys.path.append('R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/all_code'); from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch; famsearch_obj = FamilySearch('cool_dude64','rad_password224','R:/WORKING_DIRECTORY'); famsearch_obj.ReplaceDeleted("iry28rh39h83", "a")"

or

1. Open a command prompt
2. Open the R drive version of python
"R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/Anaconda3/python.exe"
3. Copy code, replacing parameters as needed
import sys
sys.path.append('R:/JoePriceResearch/Python/all_code')
from FamilySearch1 import FamilySearch
